migeratign for turborepo to nx repo to manage microservices smoosly
powerfull monorepo tool 
turbo repo for front-end frameworks 
nx for nestjs and backend  it is better jouice for nextjs microservices 
but in turbo repo you have to setup every thin manually 
is is building dependancy tracking 
betterjoice for dealing grpc kafka radis 
nx full stack monorepo 

important commands:

1- install nx globally 
npm i -g nx 

//add @nx/nest plugin 
nx add @nx/nest

2- create workspace:
npx create-nx-workspace@latest your-work-space-name
stack typescript - none prttier - githubActions 

3- create app:(nx generate) instead of manually generating files use nx generate

npx nx generate @nx/nest:application my-app-name

// create a new module 
npx nx generate @nx/nest:module my-app/my-module

// generate controller 
npx nx generate @nx/nest:controller my-app/my-controller

//generate library 
npx nx generate @nx/nest:library my-lib


the important file you need to study and analyze
see nx.json and see the plugins and it's targets 


4- build and run the application 
nx serve
nx serve app


nx g @nx/nest:app apps/app-name1
nx g @nx/nest:app apps/app-name2
nx g @nx/nest:app apps/app-name3

generate the application fast because of-
powerfull caching system of the nx 


nx serve app-name1
nx serve app-name2
nx serve app-name3


nx run-many -t serve --all

nx build app-name1 
nx test app-name1

congratulation now you are ready to implement grpc for communication between services
